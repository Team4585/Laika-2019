/**
 * The superstructure subsystem is the overarching superclass containing all components of the superstructure: the
 * intake, hopper, feeder, shooter and LEDs. The superstructure subsystem also contains some miscellaneous hardware that
 * is located in the superstructure but isn't part of any other subsystems like the compressor, pressure sensor, and
 * hopper wall pistons.
 * <p>
 * Instead of interacting with subsystems like the feeder and intake directly, the {@link Robot} class interacts with
 * the superstructure, which passes on the commands to the correct subsystem.
 * <p>
 * The superstructure also coordinates actions between different subsystems like the feeder and shooter.
